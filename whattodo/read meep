        (All contract testing functions are found in README.md)

        (Run terminal in split mode, run npx hardhat node, add accounts to metamask, 
        link metamask with http and websocket JSON-RPC server (the test node) by creating custom network in metamask,
        otherwise you wont get test ethereum, to test contract run npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js,
        same contract everytime no work needed on your part unless you deploy it again, thats the most you can do until you input your ipfs)
